Another service management system (.net, C#, javascript, jquery, IIS, MSSQL) 
A large Microsoft MVC Project for Service Management. An incomplete major project I embarked on while operating my IT business to maximize productivity. I have moved on to other things for now. It by no means is an example of good practices, but perhaps demonstrates some creative ways to accomplish objectives. There may be much "security by obscurity" in it due to the fact that the project was solo and I expected to complete it myself. I may still complete it, but after a number of years on it, and having started from strach a second time,(see repository Service Management System for first version) , I realize that while the project has alot of usefulness, and if ever completed, expect it would be quite appealing to many service companies; It is a project which probably requires more than one person to complete in a timely manner. So I have published it here as a representation of prior work.
